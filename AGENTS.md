# AGENTS.md — mandatory instructions for coding agents

This file is the top-level operating contract for every LLM or automated coding
agent working in O3K Rust.

## Mission

Build O3K as a small, understandable, secure, testable, and extensible
**Cloud Operating System**.

O3K must:

1. preserve selected, evidence-backed OpenStack compatibility;
2. converge on a shared O3K Cloud Kernel instead of reproducing historical
   OpenStack project topology internally;
3. support a native TestLab/cloud and small edge-cloud path;
4. support selected external OpenStack service testbeds;
5. make future first-class O3K services cheaper to build by reusing common IAM,
   authorization, resource ownership, service-registry, operation, audit/event,
   quota/limit, and reconciliation contracts.

Correct end-to-end behavior and honest profile-specific claims matter more than
endpoint count.

"Cloud Operating System" is an architecture/product-direction statement, not a
production-readiness or full-parity claim.

## Authority order

When instructions conflict, use this order:

1. security, licensing, privacy, and clean-implementation rules;
2. accepted ADRs in `docs/adr/`;
3. normative specs in `docs/specs/`;
4. public contracts under `contracts/` and `proto/`;
5. official OpenStack documentation and published specifications for OpenStack
   compatibility questions;
6. public OpenStack client/SDK/Terraform/Tempest behavior;
7. O3K Rust contracts/tests/black-box evidence;
8. public Go O3K as a non-normative secondary reference;
9. issue acceptance criteria;
10. tests;
11. existing implementation.

Do not silently resolve a conflict. Stop, describe it in the issue/PR, and
propose the smallest corrective change.

## Normative source ownership

Read `docs/NORMATIVE_SOURCES.md` before changing architecture, IAM,
authorization, service topology, workflows, compatibility manifests, execution
protocols, product profiles, or deployment claims.

Important authority:

- ADR-0165 — O3K Cloud OS / Cloud Kernel;
- ADR-0166 + SPEC-0020 — O3K IAM / Keystone compatibility;
- ADR-0163 + SPEC-0024 — deployment/evidence profiles and claims;
- ADR-0160 + SPEC-0025 — topology/dependency/rewrite convergence;
- SPEC-0021 — cross-service workflows/compensation;
- SPEC-0022 — OpenStack compatibility baseline/evidence;
- execution/core architecture contracts.

Summary documents explain intent. They do not redefine normative contracts.

Runtime/release claims require executable evidence even when architecture/specs
are accepted.

## Mandatory reading order

Before editing code, read:

1. `README.md`;
2. `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md`;
3. `docs/CLEAN_IMPLEMENTATION.md`;
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`;
5. `docs/NORMATIVE_SOURCES.md`;
6. `docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md`;
7. the relevant ADR/SPEC/compatibility profile/product profile/execution
   contract;
8. the assigned issue.

For product scope, IAM, topology, provider boundaries, cross-service workflows,
hosted services, or runner changes, also read:

- `docs/adr/ADR-0165-o3k-cloud-operating-system-and-cloud-kernel.md`;
- `docs/adr/ADR-0166-o3k-iam-and-keystone-compatibility-boundary.md`;
- `docs/adr/ADR-0160-service-topology-and-execution-boundaries.md`;
- `docs/adr/ADR-0162-contract-first-staged-runner-validation.md`;
- `docs/adr/ADR-0163-product-profiles-and-deployment-posture.md`;
- `docs/specs/SPEC-0020-keystone-trust-catalog-and-auth-context.md`;
- `docs/specs/SPEC-0021-cross-service-workflows-and-compensation.md`;
- `docs/specs/SPEC-0022-service-api-baseline-and-evidence-gates.md`;
- `docs/specs/SPEC-0023-external-cinder-service-under-test.md` when relevant;
- `docs/specs/SPEC-0024-product-profiles-and-claims.md`;
- `docs/specs/SPEC-0025-rust-rewrite-and-architecture-convergence.md`;
- `compatibility/product-profiles.yaml`;
- `contracts/execution-boundaries.md`;
- `contracts/core-architecture-boundaries.toml`.

ADR-0161 is superseded by ADR-0166 and must not be used as current authority.

## Cloud Kernel invariants

### OpenStack is compatibility, not the internal architecture

Do not make historical OpenStack service names define a new O3K process, crate,
store, or domain boundary without an independent architectural reason.

Conceptually:

```text
Keystone  -> O3K IAM adapter
Glance    -> O3K Image adapter
Nova      -> O3K Compute adapter
Neutron   -> O3K Network adapter
Placement -> O3K Capacity adapter
Cinder    -> O3K Volume adapter
```

Keep OpenStack JSON, headers, microversions, policy names, and error/catalog
shapes at protocol/compatibility edges.

### O3K IAM is canonical

Keystone-compatible authentication/catalog behavior maps into O3K IAM.

All first-class services consume one normalized typed `AuthContext`.

Protected operations should be expressible through:

```text
Principal × Action × Resource × Context -> Allow | Deny
```

A service must not:

- parse Keystone wire credentials as domain state;
- invent a parallel tenant-isolation model;
- treat a syntactically valid token as authorization;
- omit required durable owner/security-scope state;
- authorize after provider mutation;
- reveal cross-tenant existence through idempotency behavior.

### O3K owns O3K resource authority

For O3K-owned resources, the control plane owns:

- public O3K ID;
- resource type;
- owner/security scope;
- desired state;
- operation identity/phase;
- capacity/scheduling;
- compensation/reconciliation;
- provider mapping.

Execution providers own bounded mutation/observation only.

### Existing clouds are not ordinary providers

An external OpenStack cloud, vSphere/vCenter, Proxmox, KubeVirt, or public cloud
may already own scheduling, quotas, policy, resource identity, and lifecycle.

Do not force such a system through a libvirt-like provider abstraction.

A delegated/federated connector requires a separate accepted authority model.

### New first-class services reuse the kernel

A new O3K service should reuse shared:

- IAM/principals;
- authorization;
- ownership;
- service registration;
- quota/limit hooks where selected;
- operations/idempotency/reconciliation;
- audit/event identity;
- standard health/failure identity.

Do not create a parallel cloud framework inside a new service.

## Issue-driven rule

- One issue is the unit of intent.
- One PR should normally close one coherent issue.
- Do not implement untracked features.
- Do not expand scope because a nearby improvement looks easy.
- Missing requirements become an issue/spec amendment.
- An endpoint outside the accepted compatibility profile must not be added
  opportunistically.
- Do not create micro-issues for acceptance criteria already owned by a coherent
  issue.

## Required agent plan

Before code changes, record:

- issue being solved;
- selected deployment/evidence profile;
- canonical O3K service/domain involved;
- OpenStack compatibility adapter involved, if any;
- authority mode: `o3k-implemented`, `external-hosted`, execution provider, or
  explicitly accepted delegated/federated;
- files expected to change;
- contracts/specs affected;
- public reference inputs/pinned revisions/provenance;
- public operations/actions/resources involved;
- database/execution assumptions;
- cross-service dependencies/compensation;
- required evidence tier;
- tests to add first;
- known uncertainties;
- explicit non-goals.

## Product-profile rules

- O3K has one product identity: O3K Cloud OS.
- Do not conflate deployment/evidence profiles.
- External-hosted services retain their own DB/message bus/processes/backend/
  migrations/upgrades/operations.
- Hosting an endpoint does not mean O3K implements it.
- The small edge target is approximately 10–20 hypervisors, not a production
  claim without evidence.
- "Connect to another OpenStack" must be decomposed into explicit trust,
  hosted-service, external-identity, service-consumption, delegation/federation,
  or resource-sharing behavior.
- SQLite is the supported minimal TestLab/portable default.
- PostgreSQL is a production-oriented target until a real adapter/conformance
  suite exists.
- Approximately 50 MB is a target, not a guarantee.
- Architecture examples of database/Kubernetes/AI/etc. are not support claims.
- The current `v0.2.0-alpha.1` libvirt TestLab gate must not be expanded by
  Cloud Kernel work unless a human-approved release replan explicitly says so.

## Service and process rules

- `o3kd` initially owns Cloud Kernel/service semantics, authorization, desired
  state, scheduling, operations, compensation, and reconciliation.
- `o3k-compute`, `o3k-network`, and `o3k-storage` are execution boundaries, not
  independent sources of public cloud truth.
- Logical/domain/provider separation precedes process separation.
- Do not introduce a daemon because OpenStack has a similarly named service.
- A new daemon requires an accepted ADR covering privilege, identity, protocol,
  failure domain, deployment, restart, and cleanup.
- Never use a display name where a durable principal/scope/service/resource/
  provider ID is required.
- Native Volume/Cinder work does not block the first ephemeral-root guest.
- External Cinder remains external and is not the native O3K storage
  implementation.

## Compatibility-profile rules

- O3K targets operation-level OpenStack profiles, not blanket service parity.
- Every public compatibility operation requires a profile record with service
  ownership, method/path, API version/microversion, auth action/scope, request/
  response/error contract, state transition, dependencies, provider capability,
  tests, and known deviations.
- A route without the required profile record is unsupported even if partial
  implementation exists.
- Compatibility catalogs advertise only implemented/enabled/verified profiles.
- Distinguish upstream reference maximum, O3K advertised range, implemented
  range, and verified range.
- Do not advertise native Volume/Cinder, advanced networking, metadata HTTP,
  PostgreSQL, broad microversions, cross-cloud support, or fixed footprint
  before gates pass.
- Official OpenStack specs/public client behavior remain normative for
  compatibility behavior.
- Compatibility requirements do not override accepted O3K internal architecture
  unless an ADR explicitly changes it.

## Evidence-ladder rules

Work proceeds in this order unless an accepted issue justifies otherwise:

1. ADR/SPEC/contract/profile validation;
2. domain/IAM/store/migration/policy tests;
3. provider/external-service conformance;
4. portable simulated-profile integration;
5. process-level public-client tests;
6. execution component or hosted-service real-host gate;
7. full native/testbed/edge gate;
8. restart/failure matrix;
9. release gate.

Rules:

- protected full-profile runner is a final verifier, not requirements discovery;
- do not modify the full runner to hide a missing contract/portable test;
- fake/skipped/ready/repository-only results are not real-host evidence;
- evidence from one profile is not automatically evidence for another.

## Implementation rules

- Prefer explicit typed domain values over strings/maps.
- Model lifecycle transitions as validated state machines.
- Keep HTTP/OpenStack representations outside the core domain.
- Keep provider/external client types outside the core domain.
- Use one typed `AuthContext`.
- Express protected operations with shared action/resource/ownership semantics.
- Preserve original actor/scope and authenticated service principal for
  cross-service work.
- Persist intent/phase before external side effects where recovery requires it.
- Use deterministic operation/idempotency identity for retriable mutations.
- Define compensation for cross-service mutations.
- Treat timeout as unknown outcome.
- Observe before retrying destructive/duplicating mutations.
- Execution providers must never authorize callers or invent public O3K IDs.
- Avoid `unsafe`; each use requires a dedicated ADR/safety contract/tests/human
  review.
- Avoid global mutable state.
- Never log secrets/tokens/private keys/connection info/user-data/unredacted
  provider payloads.
- Every background task has shutdown/retry/backoff/reconnect/observability
  behavior.
- New dependencies require justification/license/maintenance/minimal features.

## Clean implementation restrictions

Agents must not:

- copy/translate/structurally reproduce non-public source;
- use internal SAP/CobaltCore/NeoNephos/customer/employer material as
  implementation input;
- claim behavior from memory when a public spec/test is available;
- use another implementation's private tests/schemas/migrations/architecture;
- add generated code without committed source contract;
- remove attribution/license notices.

Public OpenStack docs/APIs/SDK behavior/standards and independently written
black-box tests are allowed.

The public Apache-2.0 Go O3K repository may be used only under ADR-0151 as a
non-normative secondary reference. Record exact inspected paths/commit/public
sources.

## Test-first acceptance

A change is incomplete until it has appropriate:

- domain invariant tests;
- IAM/authorization tests where relevant;
- protocol/contract tests;
- provider/external fake/conformance tests;
- compensation/failure tests;
- regression tests;
- process tests;
- component/hosted/full-profile tests required by evidence tier.

Mocks that merely repeat implementation expectations are not evidence.

Do not mock away the exact authority/execution boundary an issue is supposed to
prove.
