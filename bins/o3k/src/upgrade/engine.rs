//! Upgrade/rollback state machine driver (plan §8–§10).
//!
//! `run_upgrade` walks the 12 upgrade phases with the per-phase failure
//! policy from plan §9; `run_rollback` restores the immediately previous
//! eligible backup. The engine itself performs no host I/O beyond the
//! durable state file, the rollback chain, and the [`UpgradeIo`] seam, so
//! every path is deterministically testable.
//!
//! Resumption rule: the persisted state is reloaded on every invocation.
//! A recorded phase of `BACKUP_CREATED` or later (with a valid backup)
//! resumes from that phase; anything earlier is discarded and the attempt
//! restarts (no mutation has happened yet). A terminal `FAILED_UPGRADE` or
//! `ROLLED_BACK` state refuses a new upgrade with recovery instructions.
//! File timestamps are never consulted.
