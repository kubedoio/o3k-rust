//! O3K operator CLI library.
//!
//! The `o3k` binary is the O3K operator command-line tool: `o3k doctor`
//! (strictly read-only, secret-safe diagnostics of a TestLab installation,
//! issue #617), `o3k upgrade` / `o3k rollback` (installation lifecycle
//! orchestration, issue #626), and `o3k version`.
//!
//! Design authorities: `docs/plan/o3k-doctor.md` and
//! `docs/plan/o3k-upgrade.md`; machine output contracts:
//! `contracts/o3k-doctor-output.schema.json` and the upgrade JSON field
//! list in `docs/plan/o3k-upgrade.md` §1. Doctor never mutates host state;
//! the upgrade engine mutates only through the bounded [`upgrade::UpgradeIo`]
//! seam and its durable state file.

  o3k version           print the binary and installed release versions
  sudo o3k upgrade [--to vX.Y.Z] [--check] [--yes] [--json]
                        upgrade the installation to a newer release
  sudo o3k rollback [--yes] [--json]
                        restore the previous release from the latest backup

  o3k --help            print this help and exit
